# Strategic HR Analytics

The upcoming project, part of my Google Advanced Data Analytics course, focuses on addressing an HR issue at Salfiort Motors. It involves using decision trees and logistic regression models to guide the company's decision-making processes. This project allows me to apply my training and contribute to improving HR practices.

### 1. Project Objective and Scope
- The notebook aims to analyze the HR dataset to identify patterns and correlations associated with employee turnover.
- It seeks to develop predictive models to forecast the likelihood of an employee leaving the company.
- The goal is to provide actionable insights for HR and management to implement effective retention strategies.

### 2. Dataset Overview
- The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset provided by Salfiort Motors' HR department.
- This dataset includes a range of employee-related data points, such as job satisfaction, performance ratings, departmental information, and employment history.
- The dataset contains over 14,999 records with multiple features, offering a rich source for predictive analysis.

### 3. Data Preparation and Exploration
- The notebook includes code for data manipulation and visualization using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Initial data exploration steps such as reading the dataset, checking for information like data types, and basic statistical descriptions are included.

### 4. Modeling and Analysis Techniques
- The notebook uses machine learning models like XGBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and RandomForest Classifier for predictive analysis.
- It also incorporates GridSearchCV for model tuning, along with various metrics for model evaluation such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc.

### 5. Ethical Considerations
- The project acknowledges the importance of responsible use of employee data, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.
- It emphasizes the need to avoid biases in analysis and use insights for positive organizational changes rather than punitive measures against employees.
